        <p>Hey evreyone! I'm a computer science major and this is my first semester at BYUI.
            I'm an avid reader, but I also enjoy to create things. So learning how to use 
            HTML5 will be a great opportunity for me this semester.
            I Think that BYUI has been a super great place so far. The atmospher here from 
            my peers and teachers has been great so far. I kinda knew that this would be the case 
            since my two sisters have already been attending.
        </p>
        <p>I've been a member of the church my whole life. It has been a blessing in so many
            ways that I can't imagine what my life would be like without it. I recently finished my
            mission to the Zimbabwe, Bulawayo mission. My favorite quote would have to come from
            Elder Dube who is from Zimbabwe. His message about looking ahead and believing is
            something I think people need to hear. Also the "I felt like a baby!" quote really does
            brighten anyones day.
        </p>
        <p>I'm looking forward to learning with all of you this semester!</p>
